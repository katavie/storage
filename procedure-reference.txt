Summary of experimental procedure:
    - Collect the following information:
        * Name
        * Color
        * Animal
        * Random text (in order to slow down times, which may lead to a greater and more noticeable difference between performance of APIs)
    - Store the information:
        * Web Storage: in localStorage variables
        * Cookies: to individual cookies / one object?
        * IndexedDB: to one database, with data in 4 key-value pairs
    - Retrieve and display the information:
        * Web Storage: get variables and display in the innerHTML of a blank element
        * Cookies: get cookies and display in the innerHTML of a blank element
        * IndexedDB: get items and display in the innerHTML of a blank element
        * Do not separate variables with any characters (spaces, commas, etc.)
            ~ var1 + var2, not var1 + " " + var2
